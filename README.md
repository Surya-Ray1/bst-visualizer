# bst-visualizer
This web-based application allows users to visualize operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST). Users can perform operations such as inserting, searching, and deleting values in the tree, as well as traversing it using different traversal techniques. The application provides real-time animations to illustrate each step of the BST operations, making it easier to understand the underlying algorithms.
